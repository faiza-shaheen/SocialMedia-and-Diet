## Introduction
Social media has become a major influence on lifestyle behaviors, particularly among young adults. Platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube shape food choices through trends, influencers, and diet-related content. While social media can promote healthy eating, it may also contribute to disordered eating patterns, body image concerns, and misinformation.

## Aim
To review existing literature on the relationship between social media use and dietary behaviors.

## Methodology
This project is a narrative literature review based on peer-reviewed journal articles. Studies examining social media exposure, eating habits, body image, and nutrition-related behaviors were included.

## Key Findings
- Increased social media exposure is associated with altered eating patterns.
- Influencer-driven content may encourage restrictive or fad diets.
- Social media can both positively and negatively affect nutrition knowledge.

## Public Health Relevance
Understanding the influence of social media on diet is essential for developing digital health education strategies and combating nutrition misinformation.

## Conclusion
Social media plays a significant role in shaping dietary behaviors. Public health interventions should focus on promoting evidence-based nutrition information across digital platforms.
